# Zoomer Lua

I, like many others, have difficulty learning Lua with its archaic syntax and legacy from bygone generations.

For this reason, I have created a version of Lua that is more modern, and easier to learn.

# Usage

This is based on Lua 5.4.6, I have no plans of maintaining this

The syntax is as follows: ```
==       = be
=        = finna_be
not      = cap
break    = pause
return   = yeet
~=       = aint
+        = gangup
nil      = dead
while    = cuh
for      = fo
false    = cappin
true     = nocap
>        = ratios
<        = stans
end      = frfr
do       = lock_in
until    = rn
local    = deadass
function = chief
else     = aight
elseif   = aight_ong
if       = ong
and      = n
or       = mf
in       = bouta
repeat   = cook
then     = bet
..       = gang
-        = fanum_tax
*        = af
%        = mid
/        = ratio
[        = [
]        = ]
{        = {
}        = }
(        = (
)        = )
^        = asf
#        = squad
print    = yap
pcall    = fuck_around
```

# Building
From the Lua 5.4 readme:
> In most common Unix-like platforms, simply do "make". Here are the details.
>
> Open a terminal window and move to the top-level directory, which is named lua-5.4.6. The Makefile there controls both the build process and the installation process.
> Do "make". The Makefile will guess your platform and build Lua for it.
> If the guess failed, do "make help" and see if your platform is listed. The platforms currently supported are:
> guess aix bsd c89 freebsd generic ios linux linux-readline macosx mingw posix solaris
>
> If your platform is listed, just do "make xxx", where xxx is your platform name.
>
> If your platform is not listed, try the closest one or posix, generic, c89, in this order.
>
> The compilation takes only a few moments and produces three files in the src directory: lua (the interpreter), luac (the compiler), and liblua.a (the library).
> To check that Lua has been built correctly, do "make test" after building Lua. This will run the interpreter and print its version.

Or if that sounds too hard to you, just grab a precompiled executable from the releases
